## Description of Twitter data

* Our Twitter dataset including 20,705 tweets are in the csv file **hatespeech_twitter_released_hypertext_2017.csv**

* There are three columns: 

	1. **Tweet id**: Unfortunately Twitter does not allow developers to share the full tweet json object, but only the tweet id. You need to refetch the tweet object using these tweet ids. Note that some tweets might be unavailable due to account deletion, tweet deletion or account suspension between 2015 (when the data was collected) and now. 

	1. **Hate targets extracted from the tweet text**: Groups of people extracted from the tweet text who are the subject of hate in the tweet. E.g., for a hypothetical tweet "I strongly hate/dislike black people", "black people" is the hate target.

	1. **Hate categories assigned by us**: We manually labeled each hate_target into one of our hate categories and put the manual label in this column. For a comprehensive list of the hate categories, check our paper.

* **Full tweet objects corresponsing to these tweet ids for academic research purposes are available upon request. please follow the instructions provided in [agreement-tweetobject.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mainack/hatespeech-data-HT-2017/master/agreement-tweetobject.txt).**
